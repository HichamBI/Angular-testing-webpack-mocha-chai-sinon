Using :

+ **Angular v4.1.1**.

+ **Webpack v2.2.1**.

+ **Jsdom v10.1.0**.

+ **Mocha-webpack** for Node testing.

+ **Mocha-loader** for browser testing.

+ **Chai**, **Chai-spies** and **Sinon** for assertions, mocking, spying.


Clone the repo and do : 

    npm install

Launch Node tests with : 

    npm test

Launch Browser tests with : 

    npm run test:server
    
Go to [localhost:8888]() to see the results.

Hope that can help.
