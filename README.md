Running Angular 2 Tests with Webpack, Mocha, Chai and Sinon on Both, Node & Browser.
---


Using :

+ **Webpack v2**.

+ **mocha-webpack** and **jsdom** for tests on node.

+ **mocha-loader** for tests on browser.

+ **Chai** and **Sinon** for assertions and mocking.


First thing to do : 

    npm install && typings install

Launch Node tests with : 

    npm test

Launch Browser tests with : 

    npm run test:server
    
Go to [localhost:8888]() to see the results.



You can find some explaination [here](http://hichambi.github.io/2016/12/27/testing-angular2-with-webpack-mocha-on-browser-and-node.html).

Hope that can help.

Thanks,
